- debian-10-bios
- debian-10-uefi
- debian-unstable-2020
add mechanism for updating this repository somehow
ability to specify standard image instead of uploading an image every time
ability to cache an image at least for some time for repeated tests
ability to specify commands to run in the target environment
ability to include input files and receive output files
ability to run commands to run when the image has been written but not yet booted
- for testing e.g. modifications to initramfs or maybe efibootmgr?
ability to get at least log output incrementally during the test execution
ability to stop the job forcibly from client
ability to at least install packages from debian mirrors
- maybe with a http proxy?
ability to specify different capabilities for different apikeys
- for example apikey with longer maximum timeout or no network restrictions
ability to see length of the job queue when waiting
ability to interactively connect to the target system during test, via SSH?
ability to specify job details over the http api
- timeout
- reboot type
- what information to capture
- network restrictions?
hdmi capture card
hard timeout and soft timeout that can be pinged with http commands
add support for multiple machines and some ability to select which one to use
